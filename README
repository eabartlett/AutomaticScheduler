This program uses an algorithm to assign event shifts to fraternity brothers
and automatically exports the results to an excel file.

*** Algorithm Explanation ***

The selection process for shift assignment is really very straightforward.
Here's how it works: You are all split up into classes. From each class, the
program will select a certain percentage of people to place in the final pool.
This percentage is different for each class: for a normal night, it will pick
30% of epsilon class to put in the final pool, 40% of zeta, 50% of eta, 60% of
theta, 80% of iota, and 100% of kappa. At this point, the final pool contains
more people than we need for shifts, so people are chosen at random from this
final pool and assigned shifts. So, your chance of getting a shift is your

(class weighting) * (# of shifts / (summation of class sizes * class weightings))

No, badge is not taken into account, just your class. No, there is no
preference given to older people for earlier shifts. And yes, I have made
it so I will never get a shift. If there is anything about this process that
you don't like, I would LOVE to get you contributing code to this project;
just get in contact with me, and I can get you up to speed.


*** Running the Program ***

Run with the command: python random_scheduler.py

The program will first ask what the date of the event is. This date will show
up at the top of the Excel spreadsheet when it is printed.

The program will then ask whether the event is a special event. A normal
event includes two bar shifts, two door shifts, and a roof shift.
A special event includes upstairs and downstairs bar assignments, courtyard
and back door assignments, and a roof shift.

The third question the program will ask if any brothers will be absent. If 
the answer is yes, the program will prompt for a brother's name. Enter one
brother's name per line. If this is the last absent brother, put a period
after the brother's name.

Finally, the program will write an excel file named "PhiPsiShifts.xslx" and
open it.
