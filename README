This program uses an algorithm to assign event shifts to fraternity brothers
and automatically exports the results to an excel file.

*** Running the Program ***

Run with the command: python random_scheduler.py

The program will first ask what the date of the event is. This date will show
up at the top of the Excel spreadsheet when it is printed.

The program will then ask whether the event is a special event. A normal
event includes two bar shifts, two door shifts, and a roof shift.
A special event includes upstairs and downstairs bar assignments, courtyard
and back door assignments, and a roof shift.

The third question the program will ask if any brothers will be absent. If 
the answer is yes, the program will prompt for a brother's name. Enter one
brother's name per line. If this is the last absent brother, put a period
after the brother's name.

Finally, the program will write an excel file named "PhiPsiShifts.xslx" and
open it.
